# Topology Optimization Experiment Planning

1. Call `research_get_context`, then `research_get_budget`.
2. Identify exactly one current scientific question.
3. Prefer the smallest direct MATLAB grid capable of answering the question; use `VERIFY_CANDIDATE` when a refined grid is justified.
4. Avoid any configuration already present in recent experiments.
5. Express the next action as an intent; never choose raw parameters yourself.
6. Call `policy_compile_intent`, preview every returned proposal, then submit only proposals marked safe.
7. End the turn immediately after submission. The worker runs FEM asynchronously.

Valid intents include `ESTABLISH_BASELINE`, `EXPLORE_PARAMETER`, `REDUCE_GRAYNESS`,
`RESTORE_CONNECTIVITY`, `TEST_COMPETING_EXPLANATIONS`, and `VERIFY_CANDIDATE`.
